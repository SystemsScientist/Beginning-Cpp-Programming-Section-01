Section 01: How Does This Work
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How Does All This Work?

	- You must tell the computer EXACTLY what to do

		+ Program - like a recipe

	- Programming language

		+ source code
		+ high-level
		+ for humans

	- Editor - used to enter program text

		+ .cpp and .h files

	- Binary or other low-level representation

		+ object code
		+ for computers

	- Compiler - translates from high-level to low-level

	- Linker - links together our codde with other libraries

		+ creates executable program

	- Testing and Debugging - finding and fixing program errors


The C++ Build Process

	1. Source code

	2. C++ compiler

	3. Object code

	4. Linker
	
		+ produces executable program name_of_file.exe
	
			- C++ Standard Library
			- other libraries
